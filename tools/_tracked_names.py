"""Refuses a repository that versions files whose names come from a Windows path that was not translated.

A Windows path such as C:\\Users\\x handed to a Linux program (WSL) is taken for a relative path whose first folder is called "C:"
(shown as "C" followed by U+F03A when the file system has to store it on Windows): whatever the program writes there ends up
inside the repository, and a careless `git add` versions it. No file of these repositories has a name with a colon, and none
starts with a folder named like a drive or like a user profile.
